/**
 * Interface for algorithms that organize data values into histogram bins.
 * <p>
 * A binning engine takes a collection of numeric data values and groups them into discrete
 * bins (intervals) for histogram visualization and statistical analysis. Different binning
 * strategies can be implemented to provide various trade-offs between data visualization
 * clarity and statistical accuracy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Common binning strategies include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Equal-width binning: All bins have the same width</li>
 *   <li>Equal-frequency binning: All bins contain approximately the same number of values</li>
 *   <li>Fixed-bin binning: Using predetermined bin boundaries</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The binning process typically involves:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Analyzing the input data range and distribution</li>
 *   <li>Determining appropriate bin boundaries</li>
 *   <li>Counting values that fall within each bin</li>
 *   <li>Calculating bin densities or frequencies</li>
 * </ol>
