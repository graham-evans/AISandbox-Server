/**
 * Record representing the contents and statistics of a single bin in a histogram.
 * <p>
 * This record encapsulates all the information about a bin used in data distribution analysis,
 * including its boundaries, the number of data points it contains, and its calculated density. It
 * is typically used in conjunction with {@link StatisticsUtils} for creating histograms and
 * analyzing data distributions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * BinContents bin = new BinContents(0.0, 1.0, 15, 0.75);
 * System.out.println("Bin [" + bin.binStart() + "-" + bin.binEnd() + "] contains " +
 *                    bin.quantity() + " values");
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param binStart the start boundary of the bin (inclusive)
 * @param binEnd   the end boundary of the bin (inclusive)
 * @param quantity the number of data points that fall within this bin
 * @param density  the calculated density of this bin (typically quantity divided by bin width)
