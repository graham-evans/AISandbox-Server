# AI Sandbox - Simulation Server

Server simulations for learning Reinforcement Learning and action based AI.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a re-implementation of the AISandbox-Client project, with the integration changed to use protobuf.
> We are nearing completion of version 2.0, so users are encouraged to try the new software out and report bugs via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/graham-evans/AISandbox-Server/issues).
