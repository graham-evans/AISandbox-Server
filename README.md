# AI Sandbox - Simulation Server

Server simulations for learning Reinforcement Learning and action based AI.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a re-implementation of the AISandbox-Client project, with the integration changed to use protobuf. There
is a lot of work to be done before this replaces the original project, so for now, users are advised to use
the [AISandbox-Client](https://github.com/graham-evans/AISandbox-Client).

# Progress

Before v2.0.0 is released, the following changes are needed

## v2.0.0 Milestone 1 - Feb 2025

- [x] All simulations converted to use protobuf and have basic functionality  
- [x] UI framework implemented
- [x] CLI framework implemented

## v2.0.0 Milestone 2 - May 2025

- [x] UI for all simulations (layout and widgets complete)

## v2.0.0 Release Candidate 1

- [ ] UI tweaks
- [ ] Finalise theme colours
- [ ] Demos available for Java
- [ ] Demos available for Python
- [ ] Documentation complete

At this point the new sandbox should be feature complete, fully documented and include sample code for all simulations.
I'll then be working on final bugfixes and deployment builds.
