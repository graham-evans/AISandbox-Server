# AISandbox-Server

Server simulations for learning Reinforcement Learning and action based AI.

Note: This is a re-implementation of the AISandbox-Client project, with the integration changed to use protobuf. There is a lot of work to be done before this replaces the original project, so for now, users are advised to use the [AISandbox-Client](https://github.com/graham-evans/AISandbox-Client).

Status - Currently 2.0.0 Milestone Release 1 complete. Reimplemented with ProtoBuf integration.
