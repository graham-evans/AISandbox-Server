# Licence Information

The AI Sandbox codebase is licenced under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), the full text of which can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#license-text). As a summary, the GPL licence:

- Gives you the freedom to run, study, share and update the software.
- Forces you to release any changes to the software under a similar licence.
- Prevents you for turning the AI Sandbox software into a commercial product.

We’ve chosen to do this, as we believe this is the licence that most accurately reflects the original goal of AI Sandbox; which is to help users get started with AI.

For the sake of clarity, this licences govern how the application, source code and graphics can be distributed. Any AI you write using the sandbox, or any screenshots / video you make of your AI running is entirely owned by you. So this means you can:

- Write an AI (using AI Sandbox to train against), then sell it.
- Take a screencast (or output video) and upload it to YouTube.
- Use AI Sandbox to create your own AI tutorial.

But if you do, we’d love to hear about it.

## Libraries and others work

It simply wouldn't be possible to maintain the application code without the work of other teams who licence their work and make it possible for others to build upon it. AISandbox server relies, includes and links to the following works.
