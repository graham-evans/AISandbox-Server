# Contributing to AI Sandbox

Whether you want to create an additional simulation, or just improve our existing code, we'd love to include your
contributions into the next release of the Sandbox. However code will only be excepted in the form of a pull request to
the Github repository.

Before we can accept your contribution you will need to confirm you agree that:

1. If a simulation is based on existing intellectual property (IP), you own the rights to this (including graphics /
   documentation / code) and are willing (and able) to include this IP in an open source product, licenced under the
   GPLv3 licence.
